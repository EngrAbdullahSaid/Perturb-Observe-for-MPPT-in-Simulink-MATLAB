# Perturb-Observe-for-MPPT-in-Simulink-MATLAB
This repository contains a Simulink model that implements the Perturb &amp; Observe (P&amp;O) algorithm for MPPT in PV systems. The P&amp;O algorithm optimizes PV array power output by continuously adjusting the operating point to maximize efficiency. This project includes the design, simulation, and analysis of the P&amp;O MPPT algorithm in a PV system.
